# SpringCloudConfig
Refreshing the config changes with Spring Cloud Bus

In this project, I will create a Spring Clud Configuration Server, two clients (department-service and employee-service). 
Refresh configs on github, refresh one of the clients, and broadcast the /actuator/bus-refresh event to others.
